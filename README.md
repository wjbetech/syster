# Syster 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67c7c88b-99c8-45b9-a3e2-fa684c08003f)

Syster is designed to be a modern, minimalistic and user-friendly take on Windows' Task Manager. 

Built using Vite /w TypeScript, Electron, TailwindCSS.

Employs ```cross-env``` to provide consistent cross-platform compatibility and ```npm-run-all``` to ease dev experience.

Please read the DEV_README file if you are planning to develop on top of Syster!

The code can be downloaded and built locally on any type of machine using one of the following commands:

## Windows
```npm run dist:win```

## Mac
```npm run dist:mac```

## Linux
```npm run dist:linux```

## TODO

There are future plans to implement the ability to:
- change Windows desktop theme (and possibly Linux and Mac too although I only have Windows and Linux machines at my disposal)
- allow users to select up to four applications to launch directly from the Syster window
